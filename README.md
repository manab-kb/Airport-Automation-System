# About the Project
A biometric enabled travel system based on Facial Recognition Technology which will facilitate paperless travel and avoid multiple identity checks at the airport enabling seamless and hassle-free travel.

The project consists of two modules :
1) Image Detection (If a face is there in the frame) - faceDetection.py
2) Image Recognisation (Matching the face with already present database) - simple_facerec.py

# In order to run the project 
1) Import all codefiles in a folder and run main.py
[CAUTION: there are two main.py files, the one NOT IN detection folder needs to be run]
2) The code will be executed and a GUI Window will open.


- A ticket window will open, chose any flight and click on BUY. 
- A new camera window will open. press S to click a picture. 
- Click on complete transaction.
- The name and image will be stored in database.
- When the passenger has to board the flight click on Sign in with Camera.
- If the system recognises your face a green rectangle with your name will show up.
- Voila! you are ready to go.
